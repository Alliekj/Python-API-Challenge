Project using APIs for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

Project Highlights Weather Data Analysis (WeatherPy)

1st Objective: To analyze and visualize weather data for over 500 cities to understand weather patterns and their relationship to geographical location. 

Tools Used: Python, OpenWeatherMap API, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Key Outputs: 
-Scatter plots showing the relationships between latitude and various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed). 
-Linear regression analysis to understand the correlation between latitude and weather conditions.

Skills Demonstrated: API usage, data manipulation and analysis, statistical analysis, data visualization. Vacation Planning Tool (VacationPy)

2nd Objective: To use the weather data from WeatherPy to identify ideal vacation spots based on specific weather criteria and find nearby hotels using the Geoapify API.

Tools Used: Python, Geoapify API, Pandas, GeoViews.

Key Outputs: 
-A map displaying cities with ideal weather conditions for a vacation. -Identification of nearby hotels for these cities, enhancing the vacation planning process.
 -Interactive maps to visualize hotel locations relative to the cities.

Skills Demonstrated: API usage, geographic data visualization, filtering and refining data sets, interactive map creation.
