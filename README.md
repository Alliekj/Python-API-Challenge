## Python API Challenege 

Project using weather APIs for data retrieval, processing, and visualization. I used AI for debugging.

# Python API Challenge

This project uses weather APIs to retrieve, process, and visualize data. It has both analysis of weather patterns across cities and a vacation planning tool.

## Project Highlights

### Weather Data Analysis: *WeatherPy*

**Objective**: Analyze and visualize weather data for over 500 cities to understand patterns and their relationship to geographical location.

**Tools Used**: Python, OpenWeatherMap API, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy

**Key Outputs**:
- Scatter plots depicting the relationship between latitude and various weather parameters:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Cloudiness
  - Wind Speed
- Linear regression analysis to determine the correlation between latitude and weather conditions.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- API integration and usage
- Data manipulation and analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization

### Vacation Planning Tool: *VacationPy*

**Objective**: Identify ideal vacation spots using weather data and find nearby hotels based on specified weather criteria.

**Tools Used**: Python, Geoapify API, Pandas, GeoViews

**Key Outputs**:
- Interactive map displaying cities with ideal vacation weather conditions.
